## Welcome to Dunn School Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Society!
The mission of our club is to bring knowledge about Artificial Intelligence and Robotics to Dunn, so that the community has an opportunity to participate in the relating topics.

## Why Join Us?
In the United States, there are very few high schools that offers courses related to AI because of its complexity. However, our club members have the opportunity to learn and discuss about the trending technology of AI & Robotics without any prior experience.

## Leadership
- **Allen Lin**: Founder / Club President
